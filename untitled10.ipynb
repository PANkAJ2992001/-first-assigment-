        "\n",
        " ANS. In probability theory, a random variable is a mathematical representation of a variable that can take on different values according to chance or probability. It's a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, a random variable is a variable whose possible values are determined by chance, and its value is uncertain until the outcome of the experiment is observed.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The outcome of the roll can be represented by a random variable, say X, which can take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "The probability distribution of X would describe the probability of each possible value, which in this case would be 1/6 for each value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random variables can be either discrete (taking on a countable number of distinct values) or continuous (taking on any value within a given interval or range).\n",
